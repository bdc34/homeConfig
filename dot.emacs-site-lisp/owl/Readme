XEmacs/Gnu Emacs OWL Editing Mode

This is the beta version of a major mode for devloping files containing
OWL/RDF descriptions.  It is based on a DAML Mode developed by Mark
Burstein at BBN Technologies, with help from Richard Shapiro and Ken
Anderson. Mark Burstein and Dave Rager converted it to OWL. 

Installation:

Unpack the files into a directory named owl/ somewhere emacs can see it
(such as c:/emacs/owl) and add the following two lines to your c:/.emacs
file (GNU and some UNIX XEmacs) or ~/.xemacs/init.el file (XEmacs on
Windows).

(setq load-path (append '("<path to the directory>/owl/" "<path to w3 mode>") load-path)
;;; autoload declaration
(autoload 'owl-mode "owl-mode" "OWL mode." t)
(push (cons "\\.owl" 'owl-mode) auto-mode-alist)

On Windows, with XEmacs, if the OWL mode files are in c:\emacs\owl\ and W3
mode was pre-installed, then the first line could read simply:

(setq load-path (cons "c:/emacs/owl/" load-path))

Then you can either edit a file with extension .owl or create one. 
If you create one, some of the initial header text is inserted. 
See owl-mode.el to change what this looks like.

To use it with XEmacs, you will have to ascertain that the w3 package is
installed on your machine. it tends to live as a subdirectory under the xemacs
installation called .../lisp/w3/  

This w3 directory will also have to be on the load path, but that should have happened automatically.

OWL Mode provides the following capabilities:
================================================================
Colorized highlighting of RDF and OWL keywords, term definitions and references. 
================================================================
Higlights primarily class and property names and other OWL and RDF/RDF-S keywords. 
AVOIDS highlighting the 'source:' prefixes to improve visibility.

NOTE: This highlighting is purely based on syntactic cues, and does not
utilize reasoning or information about known ontology definitions.

The highlighting uses the following color scheme:
  OWL and RDF tag keywords - Bold Black
  Class IDs - Blue (also Bold - Xemacs only)
  Class references - Blue (not bold)
  Property IDs - Darkviolet (also Bold - Xemacs only)
  Property references - Violet (not bold)
  Entity substitutions - OrangeRed
  rdf:collection, cardinality and other keywords - Brown
  Other Strings - green
  Comments - Red (Both <!-- --> and <rdfs:comment> types. 
     (Note: The text in multi-line <rdfs:comment>s
            may not always appear as red for technical reasons,
             but the tags are red. )

In GNU Emacs, grey is used to enhance contrast with OWL keywords 
(that are bolded in Xemacs).

================================================================
Cursor Motion Commands:
================================================================

To avoid the problems inherent in using a full XML/PSGML parser (the
original approach attempted) such as not being able to use cursor motion
commands until the file was already syntactically correct, heuristics were
used to determine the position from local context, and movement is based on
having an "essentially syntactically correct" file in the vicinity of the
cursor. That is, syntactic cues like <, </, >, />, <!--, -->,
<rdfs:comment>, </rdfs:comment> are used to guide the motion.

================================================================ 
c-m-b  owl-backward-tag:
Move to before the current (if inside) or previous begin tag.

c-m-f  owl-forward-tag: 
Move to after the current (if inside) or next end tag.  

c-m-a  owl-up-tag: 
Move to BEFORE the ENCLOSING begin tag. (up one embedding level) 

c-m-e  owl-up-tag-end: 
Move to AFTER the ENCLOSING end tag (up one embedding level) 

c-m-i  owl-inside-tag: 
Move to after the next (non-self-terminating) begin tag within the current tag body.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
To move between definitions (Definitions are defined here as begin tags
that start at the left margin)

c-m-u  owl-backward-definition: 
Move to the beginning of the current definition, or the previous
one if already between definitions. 

c-m-d  owl-forward-definition: Move to the beginning of the next definition, if any.

The first two commands (forward, back)work within a single level of tag
embedding.

=======================  MOTION EXAMPLES =============================

For example, if the cursor is at (^7) in the OWL expression (parenthesized
numbers are there just to indicate positions.)

(^1)<owl:Class rdf:ID="BuyEffectType">
  (^2)<owl:oneOf rdf:parseType="rdf:collection">(^3)
         (^4)<BuyEffectType rdf:ID="OrderShipped"/>(^5)
         (^6)<BuyEffectType rdf:ID="Failure">
	 	(^7)<rdfs:comment> Inside comments is ignored</rdfs:comment>
	     </BuyEffectType>(^8)
     </owl:oneOf>(^9)
</owl:Class>(^10)

Then the command owl-forward-tag (c-m-f) won't do anything, but
owl-up-tag-end (c-m-e) will move to after the </owl:oneOf> (^9). 

If the cursor is at (^6) then c-m-f moves the cursor to (^8), and c-m-e
still moves the cursor to (^9).

If the cursor is at (^2) then c-m-f moves over the whole oneOf tag
to (^9) and c-m-e moves to (^10), since that is the next higher tag level.

Similarly, if at (^7) or inside the preceding tag, then c-m-b
(owl-backward-tag) moves to (^6), while owl-up-tag (c-m-a) moves to (^2),
and c-m-u (owl-backward-definition moves to (^1).

From (^3) or (^4), owl-backward-tag does nothing.

owl-inside-tag (c-m-i) moves from outside a begin-end pair, to just inside
it. So, for example, from (^2) to (^3). It also searches forward, within a
level to find an non-empty begin tag, so that from (^4) to c-m-i goes to
(^7).


================================================================
TAB and Indenting Commands
================================================================
Defined in: owl-motion.el
-----------------------

INDENTING LINES

<TAB> runs the command owl-indent-line, which uses the motion heuristics
to determine how much to indent the current line relative to the previous
begin tag.  The default is to indent each successive level by two spaces,
which is controled by the emacs variable 'owl-indent-increment'.

<ENTER> will do a newline and also try to indent the next line for you. 

INDENTING EXPRESSIONS

The command owl-indent-expression (c-m-q) indents each line of the
expression that begins after the cursor (that is, from the next <tag> to
its end </tag>).


================================================================
Finding OWL/RDF URI's (meta-dot)
================================================================
Defined in: owl-w3.el
-----------------------
This currently works only in XEmacs, as it depends on the XEmacs W3 package
-----------------------

The function owl-view-rdf-id is invoked by typing m-. (meta and
period together) This function finds the file containing the definition of
the url or tagname under the cursor and shows it in a buffer. This
function retrieves files over the web if necessary, such as to view the
definition of owl:Class from http://www.daml.org/2001/03/daml+oil.daml.

In order to facilitate DAML development, it also first checks to see if the definition can 
be found in the local directory of the current buffer. 

If the url is in the current buffer, it just moves to the begining of that definition.

If the url is in a different file, then the following rules are used:

(1)  If a buffer is loaded that is associated with the URI (that is, the filename part of the URI),
  then it switches to that buffer and finds the definition in that buffer.
  For example, when looking at a buffer containing daml+oil.daml, 


(2)  If there is a file in the same directory as the current buffer that has the same name as
  the (non-directory part of the) file name for the URI, then
  asks if it should loads that file into a buffer. For example, if there is a copy 
  of Process.daml in the local directory, there is an XML entity definition at the top of
  the file as follows:

  <!ENTITY process "http://www.daml.org/services/daml-s/2001/10/Process.daml">

  and you meta-dot on 
 rdf:resource="&process;#input"

  you will be prompted with with:
 URL (in ./Process.daml): http://www.daml.org/services/daml-s/2001/10/Process.daml#input

  Hitting return will load the local file version of Process.daml and
  search for the definition of 'input' in that buffer.

  This behavior is intended to make it easier to keep local copies of DAML files, while they
  are under development, and intermix them with remote ontologies.

(3) If the file is not found in the local directory, such as daml:Class, 
then you will be prompted by
URL: http://www.daml.org/2001/03/daml+oil.daml#Class

and hitting return will load that URL into a buffer by retrieving it over the web. 

----------------

You may also change the default URL specified in the prompt by backspacing
over it (or just typing ' at the prompt) and then typing in a different
one. Abbreviations defined in the current file can be used here, so either
process:input or &process;#input would specify the URL in the example
above, if those shortcuts were defined in the current buffer. URI's without
either a name: or &name; prefix will be assumed to be in the current buffer
and only located there.

Some typed in examples:

(Let's assume we are looking at the buffer Congo.daml, which begins with
 <!DOCTYPE uridef[
  <!ENTITY rdf "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns">
  <!ENTITY rdfs "http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema">
  <!ENTITY owl "http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl">
  <!ENTITY xsd "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
  <!ENTITY process "http://www.daml.org/services/owl-s/0.9/Process.owl">
  <!ENTITY THIS    "http://www.daml.org/services/owl-s/Congo.owl"> 
  ...
  ]>
 <rdf:RDF
  xmlns:owl =    "&owl;#"
  xmlns:rdf =     "&rdf;#"
  xmlns:rdfs =    "&rdfs;#"
  xmlns:xsd =     "&xsd;#"
  ...
  xmlns:process = "&process;#"
  ...
 >
)

Then typing meta dot and then either rubbing out the default shown or typing ' and then


CreditCardType      - finds the definition with ID="CreditCardType" in the current buffer
&THIS;#CreditCardType - does the same (due to the entity definition)

process:input  - finds the definition of input in the a local file Process.daml or 
                 at the URI specified by the entity definition, if no local file found.
		 because process: expands to &process;# using the xmlns definition, and
                 to http://www.daml.org/services/daml-s/2001/10/Process.daml#input using the 
                 entity definition
&process;#input - same, based directly on the entity definition

http://www.daml.org/services/owl-s/0.9/Process.owl#input 
               - acts the same, without any substitutions

IF A LOCAL FILE IS FOUND, BUT YOU WANT TO SKIP IT AND GO DIRECTLY TO THE
WEB, TYPE @ AT THE END OF THE URI THAT YOU SPECIFY.

================================================================
Meta-comma (m-,) - owl-find-def-in-buffer -  
Finds URI definition in the current buffer. 
Prompts for an ID. 


^x-p  - go to previous remembered position.  
        Switch back to where you were before the last 
        find definition or remember-position

^x-.  - remember position         
        Remember this location so you can switch back to it.

================================================================
Inserting Definitions
================================================================
These commands insert empty (but balanced) tag forms for new 
definitions or descriptions.

They prompt for an ID first.
C-c c Insert a new Class
C-c p Insert a new Property
C-c d Insert a new Description ID=
C-c a Insert a new Description about=
C-c / Insert an end tag corresponding to nearest previous open tag.


================================================================
Summary Mode
================================================================
The command C-c s splits the window and puts a smaller window at the 
top containing a list of the forms in the daml file. Click on a line
and hit space to jump to that form in the daml buffer. The letters
'n' and 'p' move backward and forward in this list, 
showing the corresponding definition as you move. 

After changing the daml file, C-c s will refresh the smaller window's list. 
Typing 's' in the daml summary window does the same thing.
